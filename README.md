# Machine Learning Classes

This repository contains machine learning classes designed to provide students with hands-on experience in various machine learning algorithms. The classes are divided into categories based on their complexity and are suitable for students of all levels.

## Categories

1. [Introduction to Python Programming Part One](./session_1/)
2. [Introduction to Python Programming Part Two](./session_2/)
3. [Linear Regression](./session_3/)
4. [Gradient_Descent](./session_4/)
5. [Logistic Regression Part One](./session_5/)
6. [Logistic Regression Part Two](./session_6/)
7. [Neural Network](./session_7/)
8. [Backward Propagation](./session_8/)
9. [Convolutional Neural Network](./session_9/)

## Prerequisites

Before taking these classes, students should have a basic understanding of the following topics:

- Python programming
- understanding of machine learnin concepts
- Probability and statistics

## Setup

To set up the environment for these classes, you can follow these steps:

1. Install [Python] (https://www.python.org/downloads/) on your system if you haven't already( or use google colab). You can download Python from the official website


2. Install the required Python libraries. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas sklearn matplotlib torch

```
3. Install the Jupyter notebook if you haven't already. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:
```bash
pip install jupyter
```
4. To install Anaconda, you can use the following commands. Replace 'Anaconda3-2021.05-Linux-x86_64.sh' with the actual file name.

```bash
wget https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2021.05-Linux-x86_64.sh
bash Anaconda3-2021.05-Linux-x86_64.sh
```
5. After installation, you can run the following command to launch Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```
6. Open the Jupyter Notebook and navigate to the directory where you have cloned the files and start you journey!
